Project Title: Math String to In-Order Binary Tree Converter
Description:
This project aims to develop a robust solution that converts mathematical expressions, provided as strings, into visual representations of in-order binary trees. The primary objective is to facilitate a deeper understanding of mathematical expressions through visual analysis, aiding in educational and development contexts where visualization can enhance comprehension and debugging processes.

Back-end Development (C#):
The back-end of the project is engineered using C#, leveraging the principles of Stacks and Binary Trees to parse and convert the input math string into an in-order binary tree representation. The process begins with the input math string, which includes operations and operands in a linear sequence. Utilizing a Stack, the system meticulously parses the string, identifying the hierarchy and precedence of operations to construct a binary tree. Each node in the binary tree represents an operand or an operator, structured in such a way that reflects the original mathematical expression's order and hierarchy.

Data Transfer:
Upon successful conversion of the math string into an in-order binary tree structure, the data is serialized and transferred from the C# back-end to the Python-based UI. This transfer is designed to be efficient and secure, ensuring that the tree structure is intact and ready for visualization in the Python environment.

Front-end Visualization (Python, Tkinter, and Canvas):
The front-end interface is built using Python, specifically employing Tkinter and Canvas for graphical representation. Tkinter, a widely-used GUI toolkit in Python, provides the necessary framework for developing desktop applications, while Canvas offers the capability to draw and render shapes. In this project, Tkinter's Canvas is utilized to visually draw the binary tree, where each node represents a part of the mathematical expression, accurately mirroring the tree's structure generated by the back-end. Users can interact with the UI to view different parts of the binary tree, enhancing their understanding of the mathematical expression's structure and components.

Project Impact:
By bridging the gap between abstract mathematical expressions and their concrete binary tree representations, this project aims to serve as a valuable tool for educators, students, and developers alike. It provides a unique approach to visualizing and understanding the underlying structure of mathematical expressions, fostering a deeper comprehension and appreciation for mathematical logic and computer science principles.

Technologies Used:
Back-End: C# (Stack, Binary Tree)
Data Transfer: Serialization between C# and Python
Front-End: Python, Tkinter, Canvas
Conclusion:
The Math String to In-Order Binary Tree Converter project stands as a testament to the power of combining traditional computer science concepts with modern programming languages and frameworks. It showcases how complex mathematical expressions can be made visually accessible and understandable, opening up new pathways for education and development in the fields of mathematics and computer science.
